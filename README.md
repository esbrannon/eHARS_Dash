# eHARS Dash on Amazon Web Services
The eHARS Dash is hosted on AWS and uses fictional data (it currently isnâ€™t designed to be realistic). The code can be downloaded from github and run locally and I have included code to create a fictional dataset. There is also code to export data from eHARS database into the '.Rdata' format.
