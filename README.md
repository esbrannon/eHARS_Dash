# eHARS Dash
This is a data dashboard created for eHARS, the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System, which is used to monitor HIV in the United States. The CDC maintains eHARS and distributes the software to each state in the US. The data systems for each state  This dashboard should work with any state that wants to use it. I will be developing the dashboard over the summer of 2015. 

# Shiny Apps
If you visit the eHARS Dash through Shiny Apps, please do so very briefly. I currently have a free account which allows for 25 hours of viewing/month. The eHARS Dash on Shiny Apps uses fictional data and isn’t designed to be realistic. The code can be downloaded from github and run locally and I have included code to create a fictional dataset.
